<p>
    My name is Frank and I am a young Electrical Engineer from Athens, Greece.
    I am a person of many interests and hobbies, and I am always looking for new things to learn and explore.
    For a long time now, I have been looking for a way to share my thoughts and experiences with the world.
    This blog-style website is my attempt to do so.
    So have a look around and feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat about anything!

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
    I was born in Athens in 1999 and grew up in the northern suburbs of the city.
    My father has many interests and hobbies, but rarely found time to persue them.
    Nevertheless, he was always happy to include me in his projects and I quickly picked up a few of his interests.
    In high school, I bought my first camera, a Nikon d5100, and thus my <a href="/photography/">photography</a> journey began.
</p>
<p>
    When I was around 10 years old, I got a LEGO Mindstorms kit for Christmas.
    I spent countless hours building and programming robots, and I even participated in a few competitions.
    This experience sparked my interest in robotics and <a href="/csmath/">programming</a>.
    In high school I joined a course for algorithms and started learning programming, initially in Pascal and later C++.
    I got my first Arduino board and started building small projects and learning about electronics.
</p>
<p>
    My interest in electronics and programming led me to study Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Patras.
    This is where I got introduced to Python, a tool that I use daily for my projects.
    I also taught myself Java and the basics of web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js as well as some networking and webserver operation.
    These skills were not my favorite flavor of programming, but they proved to be very useful in some projects.
    During my studies, I participated in and became a board member of the <a href="https://patras.euroavia.eu" target="_blank">local branch of EUROAVIA</a>, the European Association of Aerospace Students.
</p>
<p>
    Toward the end of my studies, I started working on my Master's thesis titled "Advanced control strategies for collaborative, multiple satellite docking".
    I worked on my dissertation at the Robotics & AI (RAI) Lab of Lule√• University of Technology in Sweden as an Erasmus+ student.
    Right before receiving my MSc diploma, RAI offered me a remote position as a research engineer, and I worked there for a year.
    Before the end of my contract, I was offered a PhD position at the Surgical Robotics Lab of the University of Twente in the Netherlands.
    After a year of working on my PhD, I decided to leave the program and find a job in the industry.
    Now I am working as a hardware and software engineer at the TCO department of the University of Twente.

<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    I already talked about my interests around my academic background but my hobbies reach way beyond these.
    I love art and, even though my skills are limited to <a href="/photography/">photography</a>, I have also tried playing the piano for a few years, and I currently enjoy painting miniatures and models.
    I am a big fan of board games and I have a small collection of <a href="/categories/#boardgames/">boardgames</a> that I enjoy playing with friends.
    I also enjoy <a href="/categories/#travel/">travelling</a> and exploring new places, and I have visited many places in Greece and the rest of Europe, and I hope to extend my travels to other continents in the future.

    I will leave you to explore the rest of me through this website and I hope you enjoy your stay!
