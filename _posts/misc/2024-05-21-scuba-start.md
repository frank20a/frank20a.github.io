Over 100 [associations](https://su.utwente.nl/en/get-involved/Associations/){:target="_blank"} are part of the student union at the University of Twente.
One of my first steps in the Netherlands was to go through the list and find some interesting groups to join.
I quickly became a member of Fanaat, the [board games](/boardgames) association and started joining the game nights thoughout the winter.
I also found out that the local [radio amateurs](/ham-radio) have a club but their meeting times did not fit my schedule.
The organization that completely missed my attention though was Piranha, the pool association.

Fast forward to the end of spring, I get an email from the PhD association P-NUT about a SCUBA intro-dive event organized in collaboration with Piranha.
At the time I was on the process of deciding whether to quit my PhD position or not, and I was desperate to find a way out of the stress.
I didn't even go to the intro-dive event, I just called the instructors, asked about the Open Water Diver course and signed up for it.
Today I had my first pool session and I am super excited to continue with the course.
