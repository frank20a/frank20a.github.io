Today I completed the last of the six dives required for the Open Water Diver license. 
We did a total of three trips with two dives each, in the Bronsbergenmeer, De Beldert and the Beers in the Netherlands.
I was lucky to spot some Sturgeons in the Bronsbergenmeer and see the sunken airplane cockpit in De Beldert, and the stacked boats in Beers.
An amazing experience overall, and I am looking forward to more dives in the future.
