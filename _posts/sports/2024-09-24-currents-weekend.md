Last week I had the pleasure to join a diving weekend in Zeeland.
This weekend is organized annually by the [Piranha](https://www.zpv-piranha.nl/) association as an opportunity to train on current and drift diving.
I also got the chance to do my first night dives, get two new specialties, and reach the 12 dives required for the Specialty Diver certification.
Here are some pictures from the weekend:
